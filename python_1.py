# We separate words using underscore 
# Make variable names that make sense
# Put double quotes if you want to put single quote in the string
# Or you can put a backslash \ to identify the single quote 
my_message = "Bobby's world"

# Put three quotations marks for multiple line strings
multi_line_message = """This is a multi line string. 
So please understand"""

# We can find the length of the message using the len() function
length_message = len(my_message)

print(my_message)
print(multi_line_message)
print(length_message)

# Indexing
# You can use my_message[position - 1] to find the character in that position
# Example:
character_1 = my_message[1-1]
character_2 = my_message[2-1]
# and so on and so forth
# I will print to demonstrate
print(character_1)
print(character_2)
