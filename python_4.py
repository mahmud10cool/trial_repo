## Lecture 4

# Dictionaries
# We have two important parameters
# Key and a value
# We follow the key with a semicolon and then put the value
# Kind of like the word followed by the meaning
student = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'courses': ['Math', 'CompSci']}
# If we want to print the value (meaning) behind any of the keys (words)
# Then we just print the dictionary with the key being the index
print(student['name'])
print(student['courses'])
